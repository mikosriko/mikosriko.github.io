										<h2>Recursion (April-May 2022)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="grid-container-1-2">
										<div class="text-area"><p>This recursive sketch creates a minimalistic/corporate like design with simple
											geometric shapes like squares, triangles and arcs. It draws bigger shapes,
											then the shapes divide into smaller shapes each time the function recurses. The
											shapes also have a probability of showing up, except the squares which always
											show up compared to the triangles and arcs.
											<br><br>
											I have chosen a list of palettes that is randomly chosen each time the page is
											refreshed with a different variety of shapes. I personally find the colour schemes
											and the simple geometric shapes very appealing to look at. </p></div>

										<h2>Noise (April-May 2022)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="grid-container-1-2">
										<div class="text-area"><p>Using the knowledge of flowfields from before, I altered it slightly to create different
											coloured strings from variety of hard-coded palettes. I love how it forms overtime and
											overlap each other, while its colour changes overtime. Something about strands of colours
											makes it very pleasant to look at, and it also has a bit of a realistic effect - it looks
											very similar to realistic hair. Transparency helps with the overlapping, however it is intensive on the browser. 
											This sketch also shows how difficult it still is to render strands of hair 
											in simulations and games since it requires heavy amount of processing. Unfortunately we still haven't reached 
											a point of technology where we can render anything without sacrificing something.
											<br><br>
											Noise is used in the flowfield to alter the flow of the field at random directions, making
											the drawing different every time it is refreshed. It also gives the natural look of strands
											of hair or string flowing down.</p></div>

										<h2>Mutation - NFTs (April-May 2022)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="grid-container-1-2">
										<div class="text-area"><p>The first thing that came into mind when thinking about what to do are NFTs. From my 
											understanding, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are a way of owning a digital media of any kind 
											that are cryptocurrencies which can be sold to other users. NFTs nowadays are produced 
											by algorithms that always creates a new variation of a piece of media. 
											I wanted to specifically point at the Bored Apes as they are the most popular NFTs due 
											to their familiarity.
											<br><br>
											I wanted there to be a meter on the right that represents the Earth that slowly becomes
											hotter - NFTs are known as one of the main pollutants due to the sheer amount of
											electricity needed to mine them (creating new NFTs/cryptocurrencies). The more evolutions
											you make with the bored apes, the more power you produce which means the hotter the
											Earth will become.
											<br><br>
											This generative drawing is a very abstract message that NFTs are not the future and it
											only creates more harm and makes the rich richer. This can be compared to rich companies
											who own non-renewable energy sources that harm our planet.</p></div>

										<h2>I OVERTHINK TOO MUCH (1st April 2022)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="grid-container-1-1">
										<div class="text-area"><p>This was one of my assignments in my 'Graphics' module. We had to create a bricolage
											type of image using p5.js where we manipulate the pixel data to produce interesting effects. I used an
											image of myself and distorted it to represent stress/anxiety. I implemented a screen tearing effect
											on the background and the pointing hands towards myself. This was to show the fear of other people's
											views constantly lingering within me.
											<br><br>
											Most of this is over exaggerated to show the meaning
											of the image but I wanted to also create a message that these thoughts are only within your
											head and that people truly don't care about what you do. You are allowed to do your own thing
											and you should keep going at it.</p></div>

										<h2>Sinsudoial (February 2022)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="grid-container-1-1">
										<div class="text-area"><p>I have experimented with creating vertexes while saving previous positions which I have ended up with a wing design with lines in between to create a mesh-like
											structure. Sine and cosine are only used for the animations of the wings to move in a circular/oval motion. They are mapped and altered in a way where it only
											moves certain positions of the wing which creates a flapping effect. I created a choice to choose if the wing will move clockwise or anti-clockwise based on
											the properties provided. I made sure the wings had many properties to be altered to easily play around with them to create the final sketch.
											<br><br>
											I'm happy with how it turned out in the end with different lines and shapes overlapping each other with a pleasing colour scheme which helps to distinguish
											each wing. The way they move is quite mesmerizing in my opinion and it takes a while to find the pattern before getting bored of looking at it.</p></div>

										<h2>Stochastic (February 2022)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="grid-container-1-1">
										<div class="text-area"><p>I was interested in implementing perlin noise flow fields to create a simple particle system. Due to lack of understanding,
											I watched tutorials of "The Coding Train" on YouTube on this topic. Once implemented, I wanted a static interaction so the
											particles don't just flow. I did some research and found out what I needed was called the "steering algorithm". I have
											watched the same YouTube channel on this topic and implemented it to the sketch. I took the wings from Sinusodial and made
											it as a flying plane/bird going through the particles while they bounce of it. Unfortunately, I wasn't sure how I would
											implement precise collision between the particles and the wings so I stuck to the simple circle collision.
											<br><br>
											What I like about this sketch is how the particles interact with the wings and how they flow through the medium. It's
											pretty satisfying to watch in my opinion even though there's not much going on.</p></div>

										<h2>Phasing (February 2022)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="grid-container-1-1">
										<div class="text-area"><p>I went for something simple and built upon it with multiple spiral dots that phasing each other. I used modulo
											to alter the colour, the vibration, and the size of the points in sine waves to create a gradual increase/decrease. I used the colours blue/purple and yellow/orange
											for the opposite colour effect so both of them stand out. The sketch gives a washing machine vibe with
											the vibrating drum which is satisfying to watch. When the drum spins fast enough, the holes eventually go so
											fast that they line up with each other then go very fast again which is what this sketch reminds me of.</p></div>
