                                            This was my project for the C++ for Creative Pratice module.<br>
                                            I wanted to take what we did with our painting programs and take it
                                            to the next level where you can convert the drawing into code.
                                            <br><br>The reason for this idea is mainly due to how drawing shapes is
                                            implemented in p5.js and OpenFrameworks. You have to create the shape using
                                            its function while you input values for X and Y positions, height
                                            and width, colour, etc.
                                            <br> This can be very annoying as you have to guess where it would land and
                                            how it would look on the canvas before you run it, which almost never ends 
                                            up how you like it to. You have to constantly go back to changing the values, 
                                            running the code again, until it is just right.
                                            <br><br>Using this program eliminates this issue by allowing you to draw
                                            anything you would like to implement instantly into your project.
                                            <br>You have a variety of features to choose from such as:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Line Tool;</li>
                                                <li>Rectangle Tool;</li>
                                                <li>Ellipse Tool;</li>
                                                <li>Triangle Tool;</li>
                                                <li>Polygon Tool;</li>
                                                <li>Add fill to your shape;</li>
                                                <li>Change width of outline;</li>
                                                <li>Changing the colour of your shape in RGBA with the colour wheel or slides;</li>
                                                <li>...and to convert the drawing into OpenFrameworks or p5.js.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>There are variety of issues with this project that I have faced and that
                                            are currently present that I did not have time to fix.
                                            <ul><br>
                                                <li>
                                                    I had an idea to implement layers where you could access each shape you
                                                    have drawn in order. However, I did not find the time to implement this, so
                                                    the user has to be definite about what they draw as they cannot go back.
                                                </li><br>
                                                <li>
                                                    The current output of the code is inefficient as it creates too many pushes
                                                    and pops for each shape. I tried to minimise this by checking the properties
                                                    of the previous shape and the current shape drawn - if they match, the
                                                    shape function will be implemented within the same push and pop. This
                                                    would have helped to minimise lines of code. I could not implement this
                                                    at the end due to saving the values of the RGBA caused one of the values
                                                    to randomly decrease or increase by a little bit. I have no idea why
                                                    this issue occured, and gave up on it because I already spent too much
                                                    time on it.
                                                </li><br>
                                                <li>
                                                    Current issue is that it will draw a point, even though the user has
                                                    clicked on each of the buttons to change tools or change the colours.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>Next time, I would like to write a better class that stores the tool's
                                            parameters, and another that controls all of them. This would allow for an easier
                                            implementation of new tools next time.
                                            <br>Currently drawing the shapes right now is weird as you cannot align them together.
                                            I would like to add a "snap to grid" function to ease drawing for everyone.
                                        </p>
